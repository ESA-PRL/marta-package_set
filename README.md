# MaRTA Package Set
Defines MaRTA specific packages and overrides.

Use this repository in conjunction with the more generic [rover package set](https://github.com/esa-prl/rover-package_set) by
adding both of them to your ROCK [buildconf manifest](https://github.com/esa-prl/buildconf/blob/master/manifest).
